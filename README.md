# etch-a-sketch
This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). It involved creating a sketch pad similar to the "Etch A Sketch" toy. The user can draw on the sketch pad by moving the mouse over the sketch pad, which is actually a square grid. In its current state, a randomly generated RGB colour is used to colour each square giving a rainbow effect. The user can erase their drawing and change the number of squares in the grid. The project serves as a brief demonstration of some CSS and JavaScript skills, especially relating to flexbox and DOM manipulation.
